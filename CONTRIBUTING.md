Contributing
============

This is a rough guide for contributing.

To contribute a bugfix:
- Create a pull request on github
- Create one pull request per bug
- Include as much information about your bug as possible, preferably a
  unit test or a stand alone minimal reproducer

If you are looking to contribute features please create a pull
request. If you are looking for contribution ideas, the following
specifications are excellent candidates:

- The [Desktop Menu Specification](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/menu-spec/)
- The [Desktop Trash Can Specification](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/trash-spec/)
- The [Icon Theme Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/icon-theme-spec/)
- The [Shared MIME Info Database](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/shared-mime-info-spec/)
- The [Recent File Storage Specification](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/recent-file-spec/)

Code Guidelines
---------------

This is a Java 7 project (for now). Please avoid using features only
available in newer Java versions. I am thinking about switching to
Java 8, any feedback about this is appreciated.
