`xdg-java`
==========

This is a Java API that provides an easy to use implementations of
various
[Free Desktop specifications](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/).
Use the correct application specific configuration, data and cache
directories. Safely read and write desktop entries without worrying
about parsing and escaping.

Specifications
--------------

The following specifications are currently implemented:

### [Base Directory Specification](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/basedir-spec/)

Use this to access standard directories for data, cache and
configuration.

Here's how to find the path to a cache file with the name `myCache`:

    File cacheFile = new File(BaseDirectory.get(BaseDirectory.XDG_CACHE_HOME), "myCache");

    
### The [Desktop Entry Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktop-entry-spec/)

Use this to read and write desktop entries, with full validation.

Here's how to read a desktop entry named `some.desktop`:

    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("some.desktop"));
    DesktopEntry entry = new DesktopEntryReader(reader).read();
    System.out.println("Name: " + entry.get(DesktopEntry.KEY_NAME));
